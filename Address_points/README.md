# address_points tools

I switched from trying to create points based on taxlot centroids to using e911 data
so lots of code here was made obsolete but works fine

e911_import.py imports the e911 address points and hydrants to the project FGDB

gnis_import.py imports the Oregon GNIS data for Clatsop County

publish.py creates a locator definition;
Eventually it will also publish the imported data!
